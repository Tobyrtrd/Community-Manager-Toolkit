        ### Educational Post: "What are Gas Fees in Web3?" (Community Version)

        *(This would be a simplified explanation for a general community, unlike a DevRel version)*

        **Headline:** ‚õΩ Gas Fees: Your Ticket to the Blockchain Highway!

        **Body:** Ever wonder why your transaction costs a little extra on Ethereum? That's gas! Think of it like the fuel your car needs to run. On the blockchain, every action (sending tokens, minting NFTs, using dApps) requires computing power. You pay a small fee (gas) to the network's validators who do this work.

        **Key Points:**
        * Gas is paid in the network's native token (e.g., ETH on Ethereum).
        * It covers the computational effort, not the amount transferred.
        * Gas prices fluctuate based on network demand.
        * Tools like Etherscan's Gas Tracker can help you find current rates!

        **Call to Action:** What are your thoughts on gas fees? Share your tips in the comments!

**4. `feedback-sentiment-analysis/`**
    * `community-survey-template.md`: (A sample survey for general community sentiment, *not* focused on technical dev issues.)
    * `sentiment-reporting-template.md`: (A simple template for summarizing weekly community sentiment and recurring themes.)

        ### Guide: What is Blockchain? (Simple Explanation)

        **Headline:** Blockchain: The Digital Ledger Everyone Can Trust!

        **Body:** Imagine a digital notebook where every page is linked to the one before it, forming a long, unbreakable chain. And instead of just one person writing in it, *everyone* who's part of the network has a copy and agrees on what's written. That's kind of what a blockchain is!

        **Key Concepts:**
        * **Blocks:** Each "page" of the notebook, containing transactions.
        * **Chain:** Blocks are linked together in a secure, chronological order.
        * **Decentralized:** No single company or person controls it. Everyone on the network helps maintain it.
        * **Immutable:** Once something is recorded, it's very hard to change.

        **Why it matters:** It creates trust without needing a middleman (like a bank), making things transparent and secure.
